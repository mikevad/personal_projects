makin' it\nThen being forced to leave the place you love because there's hate in it\nPeople say you fake the shit, never stayed to change the shit\nBut black is bein' jealous, you'd be dead if you had stayed in it\nBlack is strugglin' to find your history or trace the shit\nYou don't know the truth about your race 'cause they erasin' it\nBlack has got a sour fuckin' flavour, here's a taste of it\nBut black is all I know, there ain't a thing that I would change in it\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook, black ain't just a single fuckin' colour, man there's shades to it\nHer hair's straight and thick but mine's got waves in it\nBlack is not divisive, they been lyin' and I hate the shit\nBlack has never been a competition, we don't make this shit\nBlack is deadly\nBlack is when you're freezin' in your home and you can't get sleep but never feelin' empty\n'Cause you got 20 cousins in your country living stress-free\nWalkin' for their water, daughter wrapped inside a bed sheet\nBlack is distant, it's representin' countries that never even existed while your grandmother was livin'\nBlack is my Ghanaian brother readin' into scriptures\nDoin' research on his lineage, findin' out that he's Egyptian\nBlack is people namin' your countries on what they trade most\nCoast of Ivory, Gold Coast, and the Grain Coast\nBut most importantly to show how deep all this pain goes\nWest Africa, Benin, they called it slave coast\nBlack is so confusin', 'cause the culture? They're in love with it\nThey take our features when they want and have their fun with it\nNever seem to help with all the things we know would come with it\nLoud in our laughter, silent in our sufferin'\nBlack is bein' strong inside and facing defeat\nPoverty made me a beast, I battled the law in the streets\nWe all struggled, but your struggle ain't a struggle like me\nWell how could it be when your people gave us the odds that we beat?\nI mean, fuckin' hell, what about our brothers that are stuck in jail?\nThat couldn't bust a bell, they held a bird and gotta live with it\nBlack is bein' guilty until proven that you're innocent\nBlack is sayin', \"Free my fucking niggas stuck inside in prison cells\"\nThey think it's funny, we ain't got nothin' to say to them\nUnconditional love is strange to them; it's amazin' 'em\nBlack is like the sweetest fuckin' flavour, here's a taste of it\nBut black is all I know, there ain't a thing that I would change in it\n\n", "\n\n[Verse]\nLook, let's pour another drink and numb the pain\nEmotionally detached, she said, \"I'm numb to pain\"\nYou're asking what it's like to love, I told her love's a game\nYou learn that love is pain, then learn to love the pain\nI got a purple heart, you've got a purple heart\nYou think my work is art, and I think you're a work of art\nBut girl, I can't lie\nYou're a gem and I ain't even talking 'bout the star sign\nYou're my superstar, you're my wishing to a shooting star\nAfter hours, you're my movie star\nPop star, I've got you singing like a rock star\nMcCartney, she interstellar like Jupiter\nYou had a shift today? Cancel that\nI booked a flight, let's go and catch a tan\nI'll take you out to Hakkasan\nYou've had a couple boyfriends but never had a man\nI'll catch him at a traffic jam\nRed Light, Amsterdam, if he tries to disrespect\nBut fuck them, man, let's blow a bag on Chanel and get all them niggas vexed\nOn some different flow, acting like you didn't know\nA nigga so Gary Coleman, I got them different strokes\nYou throw it back and now I'm matching your rhythm in missionary\nI'm a man on a mission to make your legs shake\nTo make you feel it in your stomach and your chest plate\nUntil the next day you give me head until your head aches\nI heard a saying, you get it fast, it never lasts\nForget pain, there's no club inside of a deck of cards\nYou gave your heart to a joker, now you can try a king\nYou play it close to the chest, you've got a checkered past\nAnd a purple heart, wow, you've got a purple heart\nYou think my work is art and I think you're a work of art\nAsked her, \"Can you do it like the last time?\"\nShe said, \"I can, sir, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the star sign\"\n\n[Outro]\nI guess it's important that you have someone you can trust\nEspecially in the position you're in, and um...\nI think it's a really good trait that you're able to find positives\nDespite some of the challenges, for want of a better word, that you face\n\n", "\n\n[Intro]\nJAE5\n\n[Chorus: Burna

turned a curse to a gift and blessing\nAny girl that I've got an interest in\nFace interesting, body impressive\nI got ninety-nine out of a hundred marks in class on my English questions\nI'd get the

out\nBut nobody wants to see somebody make it out\nIt ain't about who came around but more about who stayed around\nBehind the scenes, they said God gave us eyes to see\nYou see the video vixens and all their pearly whites\nBut you don't see the dirty nights, long days and early flights\nYou see the deals and think all these rappers laughing now\nBut you don't get that if we weren't already, we're a target now\nYou see, all the groupie girls and think they're heaven sent\nI see twenty-five minutes worth of empty sex\nTo tell a lie, it wasn't my intention to objectify\nBut I can testify, I've seen some shit you couldn't rectify\nYou see this industry where everybody came up\nI see a bag of weird rappers and some fake love\nFake handshakes and fake spuds with fake comments\nWhere everybody covers costs but never pays homage\nThe scene turned on me, people tryna ruin me\nWhere most would see a problem, I'm seeing an opportunity\nTo drop a freestyle and kill them niggas that

thing?\nDepression when you make it, the pressure and the hatred\nYour people talk about you, you can't say shit\nThe moment that you ain't it\nThe labels are looking for replacements\nSame shit, people start forgetting what you've done for them\nEveryone in music's gonna take until there's nothing left\nYour fans are switching up on you\nAnd they don't know how tough it gets\nReading through your old comments, trying to feel some love again\nI see karma\nGo to work but God schemes harder\nI heard success can come quickly but it leaves faster\nSecrets are what my enemies have been after\nOnly L's I'm hiding in my closet have a V after\n\n[Outro]\nSo looking at it from another perspective, playing devil's advocate\nConsidering you know you're obviously becoming famous, so to

way, for your life and problems?\n\n", "\n\n[Verse 1: Dave]\nLook\nThey say the universe, it works in a strange way\nAnd it must be true because, we ain't from the same background or same place\nBut me and Lesley ended up on that same train\nI'm talking everyday, I used to wake up around seven or eight\nTo catch the 9:06 from Norbury Station\nTwo different worlds in the same location and-\nOne day we ended up speaking\nAnd I would talk about college, she would talk about meetings\nAnd how she's planning on leaving\nHow she hates what she does but she needs it\nI asked her what she was doing, it's the weekend\nAnd she said, she said\n\n[Chorus: Dave & Ruelle]\nI don't know myself\nI don't know myself no more\n\n[Verse 2: Dave]\nShe used to be the life of the party for true\nAnd now she going out hardly ever\nHer man got her in the yard forever\nAnd her friends wanna help but it's hard to tell her\nHard to let her know that her man's possessive and aggressive\nAnd she can't even see it, but for them it's clear as day, she's in a situation\nHer friend Hannah had a man that was manipulative\nSo, she could see it from a mile off\nTurtleneck jumpers, makeup around the eye spots\nAll the signs were there\nBut Lesley made it seem a light affair\nSaid it wasn't right to share\nHer boyfriend, he was a mystery man\nI didn't know much about him, but he's been in the can\nName's Jason, he's a bad boy with no reasoning\nTo be honest, I don't know what Les' sees in him\n'Cause she's a good girl with a sweet heart\nBut they've both got demons and a deep past\nYou know opposites attract, apparently\nI never heard her talk about her family ever, uh-uh\nHe was all that she had\nUntil they had an argument and he stopped calling her back\nAnd I don't know if there was more to the story than that\n'Cause she plays things down but according to that\nHe went missing one day in the morning he ran\nShe's doing overtime, struggling affording the flat\n'Til she, lost her job it fucked all of her plans\nCouldn't pay the rent, borrowing and calling for cash\nBut Hannah she was there for her, cared for her\nWhen I saw Les' she told me\n\n[Chorus: Dave & Ruelle]\nI don't know myself\nI don't know myself no more\n\n[Verse 3: Dave]\nLes' saying, \"I got nothing to live for\nIt's been raw, but David, I ain't never been this poor\nThere's no income, my boyfriend left me\nSo how the fuck am I going to survive when this kid's born?\"\nI said, \"It's a blessing as mad as it is\nAnd Les', I never even knew that you were having a kid\"\nBro, she's four months pregnant, young and neglected\nSingle but I don't think she wants to accept it\nSo she's still texting exes trying to get this\nBack on track but I don't think that she gets it\nIt's emotional obsession, clinical depression\nLife is a lesson\nAnd you ain't got to sit and cry\nAnd Lesley, living in this gift called life\nThere's no better gift than the gift of life\nSo, can you handle it?\n\n[Chorus: Dave & Ruelle]\nI don't know myself\nI don't know myself no more\n\n[Verse 4: Dave]\nBut that changed her perspective\nLate in December, her baby's expected to drop\nShe's accepted, excited, electric, pumped\nOnly got to wait a few months\nHer and Hannah had lunch\nTold her she's pregnant\nAnd they're the closest of bredrins\nSo she didn't stunt to tell her, I think that it's an error\nYou ain't a mum for a day, you're a mum forever\nWhatever, and you and Jason break up whenever\nIf I'm honest that's something you should have done together\nShe doesn't know that her and Jason are going out again\nAnd Jason doesn't know that Lesley's carrying a child for them\nShe had daydreams of settling down with Jason, better 'cause now they're together it's wild\nFeeling like she needs to call her friends and tell 'em 'cause while she's letting him down but most of them are never around\nShe calls Hannah the next day\nStill tryna figure out the best way to tell her that she's getting back together with an ex-flame\nSo she left her a voicemail\nLike \"Yo Hannah, it's Les' can you call me back?\nI wanna talk about the baby, you, me, Jason, all of that\nI've been feeling like I need to get my aura back\nI used to be so fucking confident\nBut these days, I swear that-\"\n\n[Chorus: Dave & Ruelle]\nI don't know my self\nI don't know myself no more\n\n[Verse 5: Dave]\nIt's 3:30 Lesley was meant to get a scan\nBut today I think she's going home early\nTryna talk to Jason, tell him 'bout the kid\nAddressing any reservations\nHave that conversation\nMiddle of the summer and it's raining\nWaiting at the train station\nHella cancellations\nSo she gets a taxi, sitting in a backseat\nBlue jean jacket and a maxi\nActually, tired and her legs are aching\nTouched the destination\nWay faster than the cab driver's estimation\nShe put the key in the door\nShe, couldn't believe what she see on the floor\nSome size five trainers, raging\nTears in her eyes, but it's cool 'cause they must be the neighbors\nAnd Jason's in the bedroom fully naked\nLesley running up the stairs but she's making noise\nAnd she can hear Jason's voice\nSaying \"Hide in the closet\"\nBut he's made his choice\nSo, she bursts in saying \"What kind of person would cheat on his pregnant girlfriend?\"\nJason, saying \"What the fuck, you're pregnant? What the fuck?\nYou weren't even gonna tell me, I mean what the fuck?\nWhat do you want from us?\nNah, you ain't in love, you just wanna love\"\nLesley telling Jason, \"I don't wanna love\nI don't want a you and I, I don't want an us\nAnd also, I don't wanna talk loads\nOne more line before I dash like Morse code\"\nOpen the wardrobe\nAnd Jason's on the edge\n\"I just wanna see if she was prettier than me, slimmer than me\nMaybe your baby's similar to me\nMaybe you wanted someone thicker than me, fitter than me\nTo satisfy you quicker than me\nI got your baby in my stomach and you did this to me\nWhat did I ever do to you for you to finish with me?\nI didn't believe my girls but they were thinking of me\nAnd give it to me, the wardrobe, give me the key\"\nI was pulling up the door but Jason's bigger than me\nLiterally, I remember viscerally\nJason pulling from behind me now he's gripping on me\nWhite flashes, eye gashes, when he's hitting me, see\nI just wanted to disappear I wasn't living for me\nPhysically I shut the fucking doors quick as can be\nHe's outside asking why I made him do what he did\nUsing a kick to open up the room that I'm in\nI'm feeling afraid, barricaded, with a chair in the handle\nI'm hearing sirens but I just wanna run away but I can't\nJason's gone by the time police are comin' they saw that ain't no one else in the house and feds are running through the door shouting \"'We have reports of an argument with a woman'\nThere's blood all over the floor and it's splattered onto the wall\nLes-ley's on the bed and she's tryna speak to the feds\nShe's deep in the stress and it's meters above her head\nIf anything, she couldn't even say anything\nBut she's got this really sharp pain where her belly is\nSo, they call an ambulance, Lesley didn't plan for this\nPolice are in the room tryna find the missing piece of the puzzle\nUntil they stumble on something that's kind of random\nIt's a phone in the wardrobe\nThey had five missed phone calls from Jason and also a couple other numbers so they thinking that it's no help\nUntil they play the voicemail like \"Yo Hannah, it's Les' can you call me back?\nI wanna talk about the baby, you, me, Jason, all of that\nI've been feeling like I need to get my aura back\nI used to be so fucking confident\nBut these days, I swear that-\"\n\n[Chorus: Dave & Ruelle]\nI don't know my self\nI don't know myself no more\n\n[Verse 6: Dave]\nShe felt sick to her stomach, she started panicking\nMind rattling, tryna understand what Hannah did\nBattling the shame 'cause the situation embarrassing\nShe's tryna fathom it betrayed by her own garrison\nMeanwhile, she's on the bed tryna manage this\nPiercing pain in the stomach, she couldn't handle it\nNow she's waiting for an ambulance\nLook\nAnd I know she's strong, but when I heard about what happened I was over-shocked\nHer nose was gone, her jaw line shattered and rocked\nThey said her baby was the reason she was holding on\nShe dozing off, doctors getting no response\nHer heart rate slowing down and they don't know what's wrong\nPicked her up, got her out the home and onto the stretcher for good measures but

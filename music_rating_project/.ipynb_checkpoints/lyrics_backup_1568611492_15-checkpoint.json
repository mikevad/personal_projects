down\nLaughed on the school yard\nAs soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground\nAnd I would've stuck around for ya\nWould've fought the whole town, so yeah\nWould've been right there, front row\nEven if nobody came to your show\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut you showed who you are, then one magical night\n\n[Chorus]\nI forgot that you existed\nAnd I thought that it would kill me, but it

moves\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd they would toast to me, oh, let the players play\nI\u2019d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so sick of running as fast as I can\nWondering if I\u2019d get

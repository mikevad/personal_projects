[Verse 1]
I can't remember
The words were forming in your mouth
You’ve found another
To bring you joy and play a part

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm turning inside out
With the thought of a new day
I'll only come around

[Chorus]
If you want it, if you want it
If you want it, if you want it
If you want it, if you want it

[Verse 2]
I see you clearly
You dance around and fuck with us
A feigned intention
Well, no one needs to feel your light

[Pre-Chorus]
(I’m turning inside out)
With the thought of a new day
(With the thought of a new day)
With the thought of a new
(I'll only come around)
With the thought of a new day
(With the thought of a new day)

[Chorus]
If you want it, if you want it

[Verse 1]
I'm not that kind of fool
Who needs to read the room
(Somebody tell me)
If I've fallen from your lips
Straight to your fingertips
(Somebody tell me)

[Verse 2]
Now you're waiting in the light
Patiently to my surprise
(Somebody tell me)
I pick up the superbike
Going 80 in the night
(Somebody tell me)
Said you wanted something else
Something new for show and tell
Gonna breathe until you're gone
Gonna breathe until you're

","

[Verse 1]
Point me to my chair
Make me sing that awful song
That you cannot bear
Still you take until it's gone

[Refrain]
No hard
No hard feelings
No hard
No hard feelings

[Verse 2]
Want me to say the right words
Make you feel incredible
I’m selling myself short
Pulling teeth to make it work

[Refrain]
No hard
No hard feelings
No hard
No hard feelings

[Chorus]
Won't you try
Won't you try to forgive?
Won’t you try
Won't you try to be anyone else?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I'd pace around the room
Make good friends with shiny floor
This apartment's so cold
Got no heat to fill the noise
Driving, no control
Want to crack the window, toss your phone
I'm in trouble tomorrow
We've got time to fake it, so

[Refrain]
No hard
No hard feelings
No hard
No hard feelings

[Chorus]
Won't you try
Won't you try to forgive?
Won’t you try
Won’t you try to be anyone else?
Won't you try
Won’t you try to forgive?
Won't you try
Won't you try to be anyone else?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Won't you try
Won’t you try to forgive?
Won't you try
Won't you try to be anyone else?
Won't you try
Won't you try to forgive?
Won't you try
Won't you try to be anyone else?

[Outro]
Anyone else
Anyone else

[Verse 1]
Used to be the one to cry
And feel the emotions
Needed a path to find
The strange devotion
I changed my mind
Won't look no further
Just takes some time
To come back down to Earth
To Earth, to Earth

[Interlude]
It's only change
It's only change

[Verse 2]
I changed my mind
Just takes some time

[Chorus]
I wanna change, I wanna change
I wanna change, I wanna change
I wanna change, I wanna change
I wanna change, I wanna change

[Verse 1]
I'm sinking in my bed
We’re leaving town tomorrow
It's only for the memories
So used to feeling numb

[Refrain]
Shifting through the nighttime drive
We'll be just fine

[Verse 2]
Been watching hours pass
Inside cars with no glass
Constructing shallow dreams of
Shoplifting at the Whole Foods
My baby says I’m growin' tough (Yeah)
Don't let others define you
I'm stickin' to the script now
I'll let my body win

[Refrain]
Shifting through the nighttime drive
It'll be a while

[Instrumental]

","

[Verse 1]
Tell me
Did you fall in at first glance?
Do you think you'll take a chance?
Do you think on the weekend I could know?
Show me
Before you haunt me on the screen
Will my affection pull the strings?
Another forgotten memory

[Pre-Chorus]
We've built
This city that we're sinking in
Nobody wants to play pretend
I just know that

[Chorus]
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got
I'm feeling like we've just begun
Nothing's ever good enough
Tenderness is all I've got

","

[Verse]
Pretend to play it
That's all enough
This game, so hollow
I come undone
I'll keep it quiet
Don't show who you are
Somewhere, the feeling
When you are gone

[Outro]
Somewhere I can build it
Somewhere I can build
Somewhere I can build it
Somewhere I can build
